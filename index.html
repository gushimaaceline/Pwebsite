            <h1>Get to know me </h1>
            <p id="p1"> My name is Celine Gushima,I was born in Kigali, Rwanda and this is my story.<br>
                Up until recently, I had no idea what it was I wanted to do.<br>
                For most of my life ,I went through a lot of different litsless moods.<br>
                I wasn't ever really tied down to one thing.<br>
                In fact, when I was young I was rather overweight.<br>

                My family was everything I had. We were always sharing great meals on Sunday.<br>
                I was the most spoiled child as we lived with granny, I was loved and a happy Child<br>
                I wasn't exactly the most productive person and I grew to be what one might call pleasantly
                plumb!!<br>
                I was someone who really enjoyed my time with my family.<br>
                Therefore I didn't want to admit that anything was an issue.<br>

                When I got opportunity to be addmitted in AkiraChix, things started to change.<br>
                The way I percieved things had to totally change because I have to deal with different
                nationatilities, <br>
                I had to learn from them and had something to give in return.<br>
                I made a resolution and actually stuck to it.<br>
                I needed to grow my self confidence to later see the best verson of myself.<br>
                I set goals and also promised to reward <br>
                my self by trying new things. I'am really enjoying each and every time I spend here.<br>
                AkiraChix is a comminty favourising growth personally and intellectually</br>

                Now I am very passionate and dedicated to coding.I've found where I fit.<br>
                The sun has raised again to me I can see the bright future.<br>
                I am able to dream and big because I have realised that everythin is possible.<br>
                I can be anything. As I've been given a chance to explore my pontentials, <br>
                really willing to give back to my community by giving a hand using whatever resources would be
                available.</p>

            <p>Women in Tsonga do all the domestic tacks and bow when they meet men.<br>
                They had to stay home and do everything their husband ordered them.<br>
                Patricia was independent and she was not afraid to point out how ridiculous<br>
                she finds it that Abel's family effectively treats women as servants.<br>
                For Patricia mocks these customs by going over the top which makes everyone uncomfortable.<br>
                Abel wanted to marry a traditional women so that he can have total control on her,<br>
                but the thing was that men like Abel were attracted to women like <br>
                Patricia with great personality to stand on their own,and every time speak out of their mind.<br>
                I feel like apart from the culture and noms in Tsonga community the men wanted to dominate.<br>
                They feared, that if women were independent, have a word to say the situation could change,<br>
                But also they were somehow pretending, because in one way or another,<br>
                they needed the hard working women like Patricia who can provide and help them to strengthen their
                family.</p></div>

                <p>The time Trevor accompanied Tim in a talent show,<br>
                    he made sure to tell Trevoh that ”Be sure you wear your Timberlands.” <br>
                    Arriving there Trevor was shocked to be the American rapper who was going to perform was him.<br>
                    When the host got up and announced that “modigatsi yo o kgethegileng.<br>
                    "Ka kapo amodegelang...pliff Star !!” that when all eyes were on him, Trevor was sitting confused .
                    “Dude, come up onstage.”
                    “What? Come on stage.”
                    “Dude,what are you talking about? Dude, please, you’re gonna get me in so much shit. “
                    “They’ve already paid me the money. Money what money?”
                    Tim did tell Trevor that before that talent show, They paid him money to get them a rapper from
                    America.<br>
                    Even though Tim lied Trevor their friendship didn’t end because Trevor had a great personality and
                    great sense of humor.<br>
                    They laughed at it and life continued.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="humor1">
                <h3>Humors in born a crime</h3>

                <p>“Asibambe le auntie yomlungu.Phuma ngapfa mina ngizoqhamuka ngemuwa kwakhe.”<br>
                    Trevor has learned different languages used by the South African community like her mother did.<br>
                    That helped him when a group of Zulu guys wanted to kidnap him. <br>
                    He couldn’t run away from these guys so, he just spun around and said ,<br>
                    “Kodwa bafwethu yingani singavele sibambe umuntu inkuzi? Asenzi.Mina ngikulindele.”<br>
                    Pretending that he is like them and he could help.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="humor3">
                <p>Trevor was terrified because he was the one who did it, <br>
                    so praying asking God to kill the thing which left the shit there, <br>
                    then God was going to kill him. He didn’t know what to do but he had to pray saying:<br>
                    "Dear lord, please protect us, um, you know, from whoever did this, <br>
                    but, like, we don’t know what exactly happened exactly and may be it was a big misunderstanding
                    and,<br>
                    you know, maybe we shouldn’t know the whole story and, I mean, of course you know best,<br>
                    Heavenly Father, but maybe this time it wasn’t actually demon, <br>
                    because who can say for certain, so maybe cut who ever it was a break…..” <br>
                    Trevor did what he did because his family used to live in a house whose restroom was out <br>
                    and it had holes on it’s ceiling. So, he couldn’t go outside while it was raining cats and dogs.<br>
                    Trevor had no other choice, he was very pressed, he decided to do his business on an old newspaper.
